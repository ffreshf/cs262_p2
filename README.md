# Welcome to our Design Exercise 2!

To run our code, first download our repo from GitHub. Then:

1. Navigate to the "CS262_P2" folder on terminal
2. Run the command "python3 clock.py"
3. Allow time for connection to be established; this will be reported in the terminal
4. Control + C to terminate the program
5. Review the produced .log files for the respective machines

Our notebook is included as "ex2_lab_notebook.pdf", and in it is linked an Observable document with interactive graphs depicting our findings!

The .log files for our initial five experiments are included in the "logs" folder in five respective folders.
The "csv" folder reflects the .csv files used to generate our graphs on Observable.
